###### Q) What is a hosting provider for web hosting? Give some other ways to host your websites.
###### A) A hosting provider for web hosting allows individuals to make their websites available on the World Wide Web. Alternative ways of hosting are methods such as running a Home Server (a private server which can host one or more websites) or a Virtual Dedicated Server (which allows resources not reflective of the ability of the hardware to be allocated).

###### A) GitHub supports custom domain names as proven by the following page: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages
###### Q) Do you think the emdeded styles are the best way to do this? Can you think of a better way to do this? Implement the solution you have in mind and show your work to your instructor.
